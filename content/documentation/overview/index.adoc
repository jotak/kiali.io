== What is Kiali?

Kiali provides answers to the questions: What are the microservices in my Istio service mesh, and how are they connected?

{nbsp} +
A Microservice Architecture breaks up the monolith into many smaller pieces that are composed together. Patterns to secure the communication between services like fault tolerance (via timeout, retry, circuit breaking, etc.) have come up as well as distributed tracing to be able to see where calls are going.

A service mesh can now provide these services on a platform level and frees the application writers from those tasks. Routing decisions are done at the mesh level.


icon:lightbulb[size=2x] {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} Kiali works with Istio, in OpenShift or Kubernetes, to visualize the service mesh topology, features like circuit breakers or request rates.

icon:lightbulb[size=2x] {nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} Kiali also includes Jaeger Tracing to provide distributed tracing out of the box.


== What does it do?

=== Graph View

Kiali provides an interactive graph view of your namespace in real time, being able to display the interactions at several levels (applications, versions, workloads), with contextual information and charts on the selected graph node or edge.

=== Applications

In the Applications tab we can see all the apps running in our environment.

[#img-kiali-app-list]
.List of Applications
image::app-list.png[Demo Website]
{nbsp} +
Kiali provides detailed information related to the application, such as its health or the list of its workloads.
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-app-view]
.Application Info

{nbsp} +
We can also see the metrics associated with an application provided by Istio.

.Application Metrics

{nbsp} +

=== Workloads

In the Workloads tab we have the list of workloads with their health, error rate and labels validations.
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-workload-list]
.List of Workloads

{nbsp} +
When we choose a workload we can see the related information and associated pods and services.

{nbsp} +

=== Services

In the Services tab we go to the page details of a service, we have a health icon to check if our service has some problem like error rate.

In this page we have an overview about the service: labels, type, ip, ports, endpoints, workloads, destiantion rules, virtual services...

We can also visualize the inbound/outbound metrics for this service and go to its Grafana dashboard.

=== Istio Config

In the Istio Config tab we have a list with all the Istio objects that we have in our environment.

[#img-kiali-istio-list]
.List of Istio Configs
image::istio-list.png[Demo Website]
{nbsp} +
We can inspect the configuration yaml about a specific Istio item
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-istio-valid]
.Valid Configuration of Istio Config

{nbsp} +
Kiali show us the errors in configurations.
{nbsp} +
[#img-kiali-istio-invalid]
.Invalid Configuration of Istio Config

{nbsp} +

=== Distributed Tracing

In the Distributed Tracing tab we can see the Jaeger UI in a new tab to check the traces generated by our resources.
