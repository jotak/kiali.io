On the Application detail page, the Traces tab might redirect to Jaeger via an external link instead of showing the Kiali Tracing view. It happens when you have the `url` field configured, but not `in_cluster_url`, which means the Kiali backend will not be able to connect to Jaeger.

To fix it, configure `in_cluster_url` in link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml[Kiali CR, window="_blank"] or ConfigMap.
