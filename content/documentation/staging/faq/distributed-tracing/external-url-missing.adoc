In addition to the embedded integration that Kiali provides with Jaeger, it is possible to show external links to the Jaeger UI. To do so, the external URL must be configured in the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml[Kiali CR, window="_blank"] or ConfigMap (field `url`).

```yaml
    tracing:
      # ...
      url: "http://jaeger.example.com/"
```

When configured, this URL will be used to generate a couple of links to Jaeger within Kiali. It's also visible in the About modal:
