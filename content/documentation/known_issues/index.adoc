This section describes some known issues in Kiali that may not be fixed in the very short term, and lead to limitations in a restricted number of corner cases. Hopefully, you wouldn't even notice them.

If you are hitting a limitation, regardless if it's listed here or not, do not hesitate to use the https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues[GitHub issue tracker]. You can simply _vote_ (using emojis) for any existing bug or feature request, this will help us to understand the most demanded enhancements, or you can create a new ticket. For existing JIRA tickets, use the _vote_ link or add a comment describing your expectation or scenario.

The whole list of JIRA tickets can be found https://issues.jboss.org/projects/KIALI/issues/[here].

== Non Deployment-based workloads

In Istio, a _Workload_ can be any pod or group of pods, regardless where they originate from. They may come from Kubernetes Deployments, Replica Sets or even as a single "orphan" pod. In Kiali, we essentially assume, currently, that a Workload comes from a Deployment. They should represent the vast majority of the cases.

== Graph layout sometimes doesn't render nicely

The layout for Kiali Graph may render differently, depending on the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions) and it's sometimes difficult, not to say impossible, to have a single layout that renders nicely in every situations. That's why Kiali offers a choice of several layout algorithms. However, we may still find some scenarios where none of the proposed algorithm offer a satisfying display.

If you search in the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/kiali-dev/[mailing list], you will find a number of discussions about the graph layouts.
